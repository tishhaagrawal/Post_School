        <h5>1. Why is this course paid?</h5>
        <ul type="square">
          <li>This is paid because I believe quality cannot come free of cost. And I am here to teach you skills that will help you make thousands of rupees every month. Consider this as an investment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>2. What will I gain after this course?</h5>
        <ul type="square">
          <li>You will not only gain the knowledge to navigate & grow your business/career forward but also the confidence to go toe-to-toe with people who are already in the industry.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3. How this course will help me in the career?</h5>
        <ul type="square">
          <li>Surviving in the film industry is much more than just skill/talent. You need to be able to sell it, you should know how to promote it, so that it reaches more people & you in turn attract more potential clients.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>4. How it is better than YouTube videos?</h5>
        <ul type="square">
          <li>YouTube videos mostly teach you/explain you on dummy or demo projects. Working on few clips is one thing but working on more than 2000 shots is completely different ball game. Here I teach you things that are industry standard & train
            you on real-world projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>5. I don't have money, can I still join?</h5>
        <ul type="square">
          <li>Unfortunately, no, but don't worry. You can always subscribe to us so that when we release free content/webinar (which we will in regular interval) you are notified. Also, the batches run throughout the year, you can come & join anytime
            you like, you won't miss out on anything.</li>
